Students each read a textual narrative centred on one of the following dyeing technologies: Tyrian purple (extracted from sea snails); Tānekaha Red—a Māori traditional dye extracted from tree bark; and Mauveine (the first synthetic dye, created from coal tar). Students fill out concept maps of the inputs and outputs of each process and begin considering the pros and cons of each process.",
